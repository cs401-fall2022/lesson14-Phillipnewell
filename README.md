# Intro to TypeScript

In this lab, I'm apparently a badass javascript guy here
to teach other engineers how to switch from typing javascript
to typescript and explaining the differences which can narrowed
down to very few bulletin points.

- Compile down to javascript
- Object oriented programming
- static typing

## Building

npm install -g typescript // installs typescript globally
npm install --save-dev jest //install jest module
