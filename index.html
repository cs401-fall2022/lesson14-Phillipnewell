<h1>From javascript to Typescript</h1>

<h2>Typescript -> Object oriented programming</h2>

<p>Show some code about java objects</p>
<p>Show code of typescrpt object with interface</p>

<h2>Static Typing</h2>
<p>Show unsuccessful javascript code</p>
<p>
  Then show successful typscript code with static typing that javascript could
  of used
</p>

<h2>Trans-piled</h2>
<p>Browsers are built with javascript interpreters</p>
<p>Typescript is not natively interpreted</p>
<p>Javascript is faster to compile for this</p>
<p>
  All code written in javascript works when swapped to TypeScript, but there
  wouldn't be much of a point
</p>
